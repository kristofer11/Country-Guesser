# country-guesser
 
 A simple guessing game built with React (via Vite) and utilizing the REST Countries API. Hopefully it is still functional, but evidently the api will be shutting down at some point in May 2023.

 # Testing
 
 I had an absolute blast with this project because of the reaction I received from the middle school students I was teaching at the time. They got really into the game and kept a leader board for who could get the highest streak. They also let me know what features they would like to see and I did my best to accommodate. 

 The students had strong oppinions about what information should be included in the hints. They insisted that I have a country flag for the correct country, but though the country area wasn't important (I disagreed, but it is hard to argue when all your users tell you otherwise). At one point I removed the country's region from the hints and was met with hostility. I quickly added it back!

 Another feature that came directly from the students was a strong indicator of correct guess versus incorrect. They suggested that I change the color of the background to make it blatantly obvious if they guessed correctly, so I did it! 

 Overall, I probably had more fun with this little project than anything I have built to date because of the daily input I got from enthusiastic users.
